# Overview of PixelView Automation

PixelView Automation allows teams to configure rules and workflows that respond to alerts and events automatically, ensuring prompt handling of issues and reducing manual intervention. Automation in PixelView is particularly effective when combined with Escalation Policies, enabling seamless escalation through predefined levels when alerts remain unresolved.

## Key Features of PixelView Automation

1. **Automated Actions**: PixelView Automation enables you to set up automatic responses, such as sending notifications, updating ticket statuses, or assigning alerts based on defined rules.
2. **Escalation Integration**: Automations can be configured to work in tandem with escalation policies, triggering actions that move unresolved issues to subsequent levels, ensuring timely response and accountability.
3. **Customizable Triggers**: Users can define trigger conditions, such as time-based triggers, specific event occurrences, or unique criteria, to ensure automation aligns with operational requirements.
4. **Efficient Alert Assignment**: Assign alerts directly to users, on-call schedules, or automation bots, ensuring that alerts reach the right personnel or automated workflows without delay.

## How Automation Works with Escalation Policies

In PixelView, automation is tightly integrated with Escalation Policies. Escalation Policies define a structured approach to managing unresolved alerts, and automation steps in to execute actions based on the escalation level. Each escalation level within a policy can be assigned an automation bot, user, or on-call schedule:

- **Assign to Automations**: Use automation bots to manage alerts according to policy-defined escalation levels, routing alerts to automated workflows.
- **Assign to User**: Alerts can automatically be assigned to individual team members based on their availability and role in the escalation chain.
- **Assign to On-call**: When an alert reaches an escalation level assigned to an on-call schedule, PixelView automatically routes the alert to the on-call team.

This combination of automation and escalation streamlines incident response, ensuring that issues are handled efficiently and transparently across all escalation levels.

## Benefits of Using PixelView Automation

- **Increased Responsiveness**: Automation reduces the time required to respond to incidents by automatically handling or assigning alerts as defined.
- **Consistency in Workflow**: Automated processes ensure that escalation policies are followed precisely, promoting consistency across teams and incidents.
- **Reduced Manual Workload**: By automating recurring tasks, teams can focus on more complex issues, reducing fatigue and enhancing productivity.
- **Clear Accountability**: Automation and escalation integration creates a transparent process, making it clear who is responsible at each level of an alertâ€™s escalation.
