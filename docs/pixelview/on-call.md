### On-Call Schedule
This guide will help you get started with creating and managing on-call schedules for your team.

**What is the On-Call Schedule Management System?**

This system allows you to easily create and manage rotating on-call schedules for your team. You can assign staff members to be on-call for specific days and times, ensuring there's always someone available to handle urgent issues.

    
**Building Your On-Call Schedule**

1. **Schedule Name:** Give your schedule a clear and descriptive name. This will help you identify it easily later on, especially if you manage multiple schedules.
    
2. **Date Range:**
    
    - Define the start and end date for the schedule. This specifies the timeframe during which the on-call schedule applies.
3. **Time Zone Selection:**
    
    - Select the appropriate time zone for your team. This ensures everyone is on the same page regarding on-call timings.
4. **Assigning On-Call Staff (Daily):**
    
    - Select a day of the week (e.g., Sunday, Monday).
    - From the "Select User" drop-down menu, choose a staff member to be on-call for that day.
    - Define the start and end time for their on-call shift.
5. **Adding Multiple Staff per Day:**
    
    - Click the "Add User" button to assign additional staff members to the on-call rotation for the selected day. You can create a complex schedule with multiple staff on-call throughout the day or week.
6. **Repeating for Different Days:**
    
    - **After completing step 4 for one day (selecting day, assigning staff, defining timings), repeat the entire process for each additional day** you want to include in the schedule.

**Saving Your Schedule**

Once you've assigned on-call staff for all the desired days, locate the  "Create Schedule" button  and click it. This will save your on-call schedule for future reference.

**Additional Tips**

- Use descriptive schedule names to easily identify them later.
- Ensure the time zone selected aligns with your team's location.
- Consider creating recurring schedules to avoid manual setup each time.
- Familiarize yourself with any additional features the system might offer, such as notifications or escalation procedures.

By following these steps, you can create and manage effective on-call schedules for your team using the On-Call Schedule Management System. This will ensure clear communication and timely response to urgent issues.
