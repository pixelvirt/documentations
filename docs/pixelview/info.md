# PixelView: Comprehensive Incident Management System

## Overview
PixelView is a robust and versatile incident management system designed to streamline the process of monitoring, managing, and resolving incidents across multiple platforms. It acts as a centralized hub where users can view alerts from various monitoring tools like Zabbix, Prometheus, Nagios, and more. PixelView not only aggregates alerts but also provides advanced features such as alert assignment, escalation policies, on-call management, cloud inventory tracking, OpenStack monitoring, Kubernetes (k8s) monitoring, and automation capabilities powered by StackStorm.

## Key Features

### 1. Unified Alert Management
- **Multi-Tool Integration:** PixelView integrates seamlessly with popular monitoring tools such as:
  - **Zabbix**: For network and server monitoring.
  - **Prometheus**: For real-time metrics and alerting.
  - **Nagios**: For infrastructure monitoring.
  - **Other Tools**: Supports additional monitoring solutions via APIs or plugins.
- **Centralized Dashboard:** A single-pane-of-glass view for all alerts, allowing users to monitor the health of their systems without switching between multiple tools.
- **Alert Filtering & Grouping:** Users can filter and group alerts based on severity, source, type, or custom tags for better prioritization.

### 2. Incident Assignment & Collaboration
- **User Assignment:** Alerts can be assigned to specific team members or teams, ensuring accountability and faster resolution.
- **Collaboration Tools:** Built-in communication features allow teams to collaborate directly within the platform, reducing the need for external tools.
- **Status Tracking:** Track the status of each alert (e.g., New, In Progress, Resolved) and maintain a history of actions taken.

### 3. Escalation Policies
- **Customizable Escalation Rules:** Define escalation paths based on time, severity, or user roles. If an alert is not acknowledged or resolved within a specified timeframe, it automatically escalates to the next level.
- **Multi-Level Escalation:** Supports multi-tiered escalation hierarchies to ensure critical issues are addressed promptly.
- **Notification Channels:** Alerts can be sent via email, SMS, Slack, PagerDuty, or other preferred channels.

### 4. On-Call Management
- **Rotating Schedules:** Manage on-call schedules with ease, including rotating shifts, overrides, and holiday coverage.
- **Real-Time Notifications:** On-call personnel receive instant notifications when critical alerts are triggered.
- **Availability Tracking:** Monitor the availability of on-call staff and ensure there’s always someone ready to respond.

### 5. Cloud Inventory & Monitoring
- **Cloud Asset Management:** PixelView provides a detailed inventory of cloud resources, including instances, storage, databases, and networking components across multiple cloud providers (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc.).
- **Resource Health Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the health and performance of cloud resources, providing insights into potential bottlenecks or failures.
- **Cost Optimization:** Track cloud spending and identify underutilized resources to optimize costs.

### 6. OpenStack Monitoring
- **Comprehensive OpenStack Support:** PixelView offers specialized monitoring for OpenStack environments, including compute nodes, storage, networking, and tenant activity.
- **Performance Metrics:** Collect and analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) such as CPU usage, memory consumption, and network throughput.
- **Fault Detection:** Automatically detect and alert on faults within the OpenStack infrastructure, such as failed instances, storage issues, or network outages.

### 7. Kubernetes (k8s) Monitoring
- **Cluster Health:** Monitor the overall health of Kubernetes clusters, including node status, pod availability, and resource utilization.
- **Container Insights:** Gain visibility into container-level metrics, such as CPU, memory, and disk I/O.
- **Event Logging:** Capture and analyze Kubernetes events to identify issues related to deployments, scaling, or service disruptions.
- **Auto-Scaling Alerts:** Set up alerts for auto-scaling events, ensuring that your cluster scales appropriately based on workload demands.

### 8. Automation with StackStorm
- **Event-Driven Automation:** Leverage StackStorm’s event-driven architecture to automate routine tasks and incident responses. For example:
  - Automatically restart failed services.
  - Scale up/down cloud resources based on predefined thresholds.
  - Execute remediation scripts when specific alerts are triggered.
- **Custom Workflows:** Create custom workflows using StackStorm’s powerful orchestration engine to handle complex incident response scenarios.
- **Integration with Third-Party Tools:** StackStorm integrates with a wide range of third-party tools, enabling seamless automation across your entire tech stack.

### 9. Reporting & Analytics
- **Incident Reports:** Generate detailed reports on incident trends, response times, and resolution rates to identify areas for improvement.
- **SLA Compliance:** Track Service Level Agreement (SLA) compliance and ensure that incidents are resolved within agreed-upon timeframes.
- **Custom Dashboards:** Build custom dashboards to visualize key metrics and KPIs relevant to your organization.

### 10. Security & Compliance
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Ensure that only authorized users have access to sensitive data and functionalities.
- **Audit Logs:** Maintain a comprehensive audit trail of all actions performed within the system, helping you meet regulatory requirements.
- **Data Encryption:** All data transmitted and stored in PixelView is encrypted to protect against unauthorized access.
