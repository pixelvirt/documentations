### Security Considerations

- Ensure the bot URL and authentication tokens are kept secure.
- Regularly update the authentication tokens to prevent unauthorized access.
- Limit access to the bots' configuration settings to authorized personnel only.

### Troubleshooting

    - Ensure the bot URL is correct and reachable.
    - Verify that the authentication token is valid.
    - Check the bot's logs for any error messages or issues.
