**OpenStack Quotas**

In OpenStack, quotas are mechanisms that define resource limits for projects or users within a cloud environment. These limits help cloud administrators control resource consumption and ensure fair allocation among different tenants. Project admins can create or modify quotas to adjust resource availability based on project needs.

**Quota Request:**
The quota request feature enables users to request an increase in their default resource quotas by submitting a formal request to the administrator. This documentation outlines the steps to initiate and submit a quota request.

### Initiating a Quota Request:

1. **Accessing Resource Request:**
    
    - Navigate to the designated resource management section within your account interface.
    - Locate and select "Resource Request."
2. **Accessing Quota Request:**
    
    - Within the Resource Request section, find and click on "Quota Request."
3. **Initiating Quota Request:**
    
    - Click on "Request Quota" to commence the quota request process.

### Submitting a Quota Request:

4. **Specifying Resource Requirements:**
    - In the provided form, specify the additional resources you require.
    - For instance, if you need 3 more instances and 5 additional vCPUs, input '3' for instances and '5' for vCPUs.
5. **Navigating Through the Request Form:**
    - Proceed by clicking "Next" to advance through the request form.
6. **Adjusting Values:**
    - Adjust any other relevant values or parameters as needed in the request form.
7. **Saving the Request:**
    - Once satisfied with the provided details, save the request by clicking on the appropriate button.

### Confirmation and Waiting for Approval:

8. **Submission Confirmation:**
    - Upon saving, your quota request is formally submitted for review.
9. **Awaiting Approval:**
    - Please wait for the administrator's review and approval of your quota request.
10. **Notification of Approval:**
    - Upon approval, you will receive a notification via text message confirming the status of your quota request.

**Types of OpenStack Quotas:**

OpenStack quotas encompass a variety of resources, often categorized as follows (specific names and availability might vary slightly depending on the OpenStack version):

- **Compute:**
1. **Instances:** This refers to the maximum number of virtual machines (VMs) that a user can create within their project or tenant. Instances are essentially the virtual servers that run applications and perform computing tasks.
    
2. **VCPUs:** VCPUs stands for Virtual Central Processing Units. It denotes the total number of virtual CPU cores that a user can allocate across their instances. Each instance typically utilizes one or more VCPUs depending on its computational requirements.
    
3. **RAM (MB):** RAM, or Random Access Memory, represents the total amount of memory available for use by the instances. It is measured in megabytes (MB) and determines the amount of data that can be processed simultaneously.
    
4. **Metadata Items:** Metadata items are key-value pairs that provide additional information about an instance, such as configuration details or user-defined tags. Users can associate metadata with instances to customize their behavior or provide contextual information.
    
5. **Key Pairs:** Key pairs are used for SSH authentication when accessing instances securely. They consist of a public key that is stored on the instance and a private key that remains with the user. Key pairs ensure secure communication between the user's system and the virtual machines.
    
6. **Server Groups:** Server groups allow users to logically group instances for various purposes, such as high availability or load balancing. They help in organizing and managing instances efficiently, particularly in complex environments with multiple instances.
    
7. **Server Group Members:** This refers to the maximum number of instances that can be members of a single server group. It determines the scalability and flexibility of server groups in distributing workloads and ensuring redundancy.
    
8. **Injected Files:** Injected files are files that can be injected into an instance during its creation or runtime. These files are often used for configuration purposes, allowing users to customize the behavior of their instances by providing additional scripts or settings.
    
9. **Injected File Content (B):** It specifies the maximum size of each injected file in bytes. This limit ensures that injected files do not exceed a certain size, preventing potential performance issues or resource constraints.
    
10. **Length of Injected File:** This represents the maximum length of the content of an injected file in characters. It determines the size limit for individual files injected into instances, ensuring efficient management of configuration files and scripts.
    
- **Block Storage:**
    - Volumes (number of block storage volumes)
    - Volume Snapshots  (number of snapshots)
    - Totalk size of volume and snapshots(GB) (total storage capacity)
- **Object Storage:**
    - Containers (number of object storage containers)
    - Objects (number of objects)
    - Gigabytes (total storage capacity)
### Conclusion:

The quota request process allows users to efficiently communicate their additional resource needs to administrators. By following the outlined steps, users can seamlessly submit their requests, facilitating a smoother resource allocation process within the system.
