# Pixelvirt Technology

Pixelvirt Technology is an AI-first cloud services company redefining how enterprises build, manage, and interact with private and hybrid cloud environments. Our flagship platform, Pixelview, is a unified cloud management layer designed to make complex technologies like Kubernetes and OpenStack not just manageable—but intelligent.
At the heart of Pixelview is a conversational AI interface that brings a whole new paradigm to cloud operations: “talk to your infrastructure.” Whether you’re an end user spinning up workloads with a simple prompt, or a platform engineer diagnosing performance issues, our AI-driven agent ecosystem streamlines every touchpoint—from provisioning and scaling, to troubleshooting and automation.

Pixelview embeds domain-specific AI agents trained to understand the intricacies of modern cloud infrastructure. These agents work alongside DevOps teams to automate tedious tasks, surface root causes faster, and reduce operational overhead. For end users, it’s the most intuitive way to interact with cloud resources—natural language becomes the new CLI.
We’re fully integrated with private large language models like LLaMA and Qwen, ensuring enterprise-grade security and compliance while delivering the flexibility and speed of consumer-grade AI experiences.

Our goal is simple: make cloud infrastructure as easy to use as a conversation, and as intelligent as your best engineer—on their best day.
Pixelvirt is building the AI-native foundation for the next generation of cloud operations. Join us as we turn cloud complexity into clarity—one conversation at a time.
