It denotes the total number of virtual CPU cores that a user can allocate across their instances. Each instance typically utilizes one or more VCPUs depending on its computational requirements.</p> </li> <li> <p>RAM (MB): RAM, or Random Access Memory, represents the total amount of memory available for use by the instances.

They consist of a public key that is stored on the instance and a private key that remains with the user. Key pairs ensure secure communication between the user's system and the virtual machines.</p> </li> <li> <p>Server Groups: Server groups allow users to logically group instances for various purposes, such as high availability or load balancing.

Integrating Prometheus into PixelView allows for efficient monitoring of various metrics and systems within the PixelView environment. This documentation outlines the steps required to deploy Prometheus integration on PixelView, including deployment files for Kubernetes resources and configuration details.</p> <p>1. Deployment Files:</p> <p>1.1. Deployment: The deployment file specifies the configuration for deploying the Prometheus service on PixelView. Below is the deployment file (<code>prometheus-deployment.yaml</code>): <pre><code>apiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: prometheus-openstack\nspec:\n  replicas: 1\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: prometheus-openstack\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: prometheus-openstack\n    spec:\n      containers:\n        - name: prometheus-openstack\n          image: [REPLACE_WITH_IMAGE_URL]\n          ports:\n            - containerPort: 4000\n          env:\n            - name: DATA_ADDR_URL\n              valueFrom:\n                configMapKeyRef:\n                  name: prom-env\n                  key: DATA_ADDR_URL\n            - name: PROMETHEUS_HOST\n              valueFrom:\n                configMapKeyRef:\n                  name: prom-env\n                  key: PROMETHEUS_HOST\n      restartPolicy: Always\n      imagePullSecrets:\n        - name: [REPLACE_WITH_PULL_SECRET_NAME]\n</code></pre> 1.2. Service: The service file defines the network service for accessing the Prometheus deployment. Below is the service file (<code>prometheus-service.yaml</code>): <pre><code>apiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: prometheus-openstack\nspec:\n  ports:\n    - name: http\n      port: 4000\n      targetPort: 4000\n  selector:\n    app: prometheus-openstack\n  externalIPs:\n    - [REPLACE_WITH_EXTERNAL_IP]\n</code></pre> 1.3. ConfigMap: The ConfigMap contains sensitive data such as URLs and addresses required for the Prometheus deployment. Below is the ConfigMap file (<code>prometheus-configmap.yaml</code>): <pre><code>apiVersion: v1\nkind: ConfigMap\nmetadata:\n  name: prom-env\ndata:\n  DATA_ADDR_URL: [REPLACE_WITH_DATA_ADDR_URL]\n  PROMETHEUS_HOST: [REPLACE_WITH_PROMETHEUS_HOST]\n</code></pre> 2. Deployment Procedure:</p> <p>2.1. Replace Placeholder Values: Before deploying the Kubernetes resources, replace the placeholder values in the deployment files with the actual values specific to your environment. The placeholder values include:</p> <ul> <li><code>[REPLACE_WITH_IMAGE_URL]</code>: URL of the Prometheus Docker image.</li> <li><code>[REPLACE_WITH_PULL_SECRET_NAME]</code>: Name of the Docker image pull secret.</li> <li><code>[REPLACE_WITH_EXTERNAL_IP]</code>: External IP address for accessing the Prometheus service.</li> <li><code>[REPLACE_WITH_DATA_ADDR_URL]</code>: Data address URL for Prometheus.</li> <li><code>[REPLACE_WITH_PROMETHEUS_HOST]</code>: Prometheus host URL.</li> </ul> <p>2.2. Apply Deployment: Apply the deployment files using the <code>kubectl apply</code> command: <pre><code>kubectl apply -f prometheus-deployment.yaml\nkubectl apply -f prometheus-service.yaml\nkubectl apply -f prometheus-configmap.yaml\n</code></pre> 3. Accessing Prometheus:</p> <p>After successful deployment, Prometheus should be accessible via the provided external IP address and port specified in the service file (<code>prometheus-service.yaml</code>). Access the Prometheus UI using a web browser by navigating to the URL: <code>http://[EXTERNAL_IP]:4000</code>.</p> <p>Conclusion:</p> <p>This documentation provides a detailed guide for deploying Prometheus integration on PixelView, including deployment files for Kubernetes resources and configuration details. By following these steps, users can effectively monitor and analyze metrics within the PixelView environment using Prometheus.</p>"},{"location":"pixelview/registration/","title":"registration","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Access Management:</p> <ul> <li>Log in to your PixelView account.</li> <li>Navigate to the 'Management' section from the main navigation menu.</li> <li> <p>Navigate to Users:</p> </li> <li> <p>Within the 'Management' section, locate the 'Users' option.</p> </li> <li>Click on 'Users' to proceed.</li> <li> <p>Initiate New User Registration:</p> </li> <li> <p>In the upper-right corner of the 'Users' section, locate the '+' icon.</p> </li> <li>Click on the '+' icon to initiate the user registration process.</li> <li> <p>Enter User Details:</p> </li> <li> <p>A registration form will appear.</p> </li> <li>Enter the following details for the new user:<ul> <li>First Name</li> <li>Last Name</li> <li>Email Address</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Select User Role:</p> </li> <li> <p>From the dropdown menu, select the appropriate role for the new user.</p> </li> <li>Available roles may include 'Admin' and 'User'.
